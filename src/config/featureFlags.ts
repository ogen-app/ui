/**
 * Front-end feature flags.
 *
 * The front end runs ahead of the API: a feature the server can't back yet
 * ships to `develop` with its flag **off** rather than waiting on a branch.
 * Every such feature gets an entry here, and the entry says what it is waiting
 * for — that comment is the hand-off to the back end. When the endpoint lands,
 * re-test against the real thing and *then* decide the flag's fate. See the
 * global rules in `CLAUDE.md`.
 *
 * Today a flag is a constant in this file: flipping one is a one-line edit and
 * a deploy, which is all it needs to be while the only people switching them
 * are the people writing them.
 *
 * **This is the seam for the server.** When flags become BE-driven the values
 * move behind `useFeatureFlag`, and every call site stays as it is — which is
 * why components read the hook rather than the record. Nothing else may read
 * `FEATURE_FLAGS` directly.
 *
 * A flag is not a permission: it decides whether a feature is built yet, never
 * whether someone is allowed to use it. That stays server-side either way.
 *
 * Adding one: add an entry here, read it with `useFeatureFlag('<id>')`, and
 * render nothing when it is off. Removing one is the point — a flag whose
 * feature has settled should be deleted along with the `off` branch of the
 * code, not left switched on forever.

   * Activity (CON-225): the sidebar item, the feed, and the daily report — the

   *
   * **Waiting on:** the notifications subsystem, CON-224. Nothing persists a
   * thing that happened today: `/api/events` is an invalidation bus with
   * at-most-once delivery and no event log (`docs/sse.md`), which is
   * disqualifying for a feature whose premise is that you were not looking. So
   * Phase 1 *derives* its entries from the batched campaign summaries instead
   * — which means only post outcomes can appear, and an entry disappears if
   * the post behind it changes. The two things the feed is most wanted for,
   * "your long run finished" and "this connection expired", leave no trace in
   * that projection and are missing until the table exists.
   *
   * The daily report is the half that is not a stand-in: it is a count over
   * posts, correct as computed, and it stays when CON-224 lands.
   *
   * Switch this on once `GET /api/notifications` answers and the feed has been
   * re-tested against recorded events rather than derived ones. See

   *
   * Separate from `activity` because they are different objects and will land
   * at different times. A task is a **level** — a condition that stops being
   * true when it is fixed — where a feed entry is an **edge**, a timestamped
   * fact that stays true forever (`docs/tasks.md`). Keeping them apart is
   * what stops the feed filling with stale rows nobody can clear.
   *
   * **Waiting on:** a tasks table. A task is a record — it is written by a
   * person or raised by the system from a warning, it carries an assignee and
   * a done state, and it outlives the condition behind it. None of that is
   * derivable, so the prototype stores the whole list as JSON in one tenant
   * key/value row (`tasks`), the same stand-in `campaign-accounts` uses while
   * waiting for its column. What that cannot do, and the table must:
   *   · **row-level writes** — every change here rewrites the entire list, so
   *     two people editing different tasks in the same second means the later
   *     write wins for both;
   *   · **server-side reconciliation** — raising and auto-resolving happens on
   *     the client, so it only runs while somebody has one of the two screens
   *     open, and exactly one may do it (`useTaskReconciliation`);
   *   · **telling the assignee** — assignment writes a membership id and
   *     nothing else happens; there is no channel to notify them on until
   *     CON-224.
   *
   * `assigned_to` does not exist on any model today, which is the column this
   * starts from. The row is also workspace-wide and readable by every member,
   * which is right for shared work and wrong for work assigned to a person.
   *
   * Switch this on once tasks are rows, migrate the key onto them, and re-test
   * — the intent is that the rule set keeps raising tasks alongside the
   * hand-written ones, not that it is replaced.

   * Note what this flag is and isn't. A flag decides whether a feature is built
   * yet; it is never who is allowed to see what. That is exactly why tiers get
   * their own seam (`useEntitlement`) instead of entries in this file: the

   * asserted by its test. CON-208 (tenant tiers and groups) and CON-86 (usage
   * metering and per-tenant cost limits) are both done server-side, so the
   * tiers and the counters exist; what is missing is a workspace-scoped REST
   * read that puts them together. Three things it must carry that are easy to
   * leave out:
   *
   * 1. **The resolved numbers, not a tier name.** Tiers are versioned and
   *    configurable and a workspace keeps the version it bought, so the name is
   *    a label two workspaces can share while holding different allowances.
   * 2. **`scheduled_change`.** A downgrade lands at the next billing boundary,
   *    so the workspace is on one tier while another is already bought. The
   *    client cannot derive it and must not try.
   * 3. **`used` beside every `limit`.** Without the counter the UI can only
   *    apologise after the click instead of disabling the control.
   *
   * And one thing that belongs elsewhere: a downgrade suspends rather than
   * deletes, and the server picks which campaign goes read-only — so the
   * `suspended` flag has to ride on the resource. The client must never work it
   * out by counting, or it picks a different victim than the server did.
   *
   * With this off nothing asks, nothing renders a lock, and every feature is
   * available exactly as it was before tiers existed.
   *
   * **Turn it on locally to look at it, and turn it back off before you
   * commit.** The plan screen and the billing card are driven by a
   * `localStorage` stub (`services/api/tiers.stub.ts`) so the tier
   * differentiation can be built and reviewed; a stub is not a reason to ship
   * the feature on.
