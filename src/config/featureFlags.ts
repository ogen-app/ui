/**
 * Front-end feature flags.
 *
 * The front end runs ahead of the API: a feature the server can't back yet
 * ships to `develop` with its flag **off** rather than waiting on a branch.
 * Every such feature gets an entry here, and the entry says what it is waiting
 * for — that comment is the hand-off to the back end. When the endpoint lands,
 * re-test against the real thing and *then* decide the flag's fate. See the
 * global rules in `CLAUDE.md`.
 *
 * Today a flag is a constant in this file: flipping one is a one-line edit and
 * a deploy, which is all it needs to be while the only people switching them
 * are the people writing them.
 *
 * **This is the seam for the server.** When flags become BE-driven the values
 * move behind `useFeatureFlag`, and every call site stays as it is — which is
 * why components read the hook rather than the record. Nothing else may read
 * `FEATURE_FLAGS` directly.
 *
 * A flag is not a permission: it decides whether a feature is built yet, never
 * whether someone is allowed to use it. That stays server-side either way.
 *
 * Adding one: add an entry here, read it with `useFeatureFlag('<id>')`, and
 * render nothing when it is off. Removing one is the point — a flag whose
 * feature has settled should be deleted along with the `off` branch of the
 * code, not left switched on forever.

   *
   * **Waiting on:** an account dimension on the campaign. `CampaignPlatform` is
   * `{id, post_types}` (`models/types.go`), the column is jsonb, and the
   * handler drops any field it doesn't know — so a per-account choice sent to
   * `PUT /api/campaigns/:id` is lost on the round trip. It needs
   * `CampaignPlatform.AccountID` (`""` = the placeholder kind, i.e. today's
   * platform-level entry) with the content-plan flow and the submit worker
   * reading it, plus a uniqueness rule on `(platform, account)`.
   *
   * Until then the choice lives in the tenant key/value store
   * (`campaign-accounts.<campaignId>`, see `useCampaignAccounts`) and the
   * campaign's own `target_platforms` is written from it at platform
   * granularity, so nothing downstream reads half-backed data. When the column
   * lands, migrate the key onto it, re-test, and delete this flag with its

   * measure nothing, and no analytics request is made. Turning it on swaps
   * that preview for the real totals in both places.
   *
   * **Waiting on:** a campaign dimension on `GET /api/analytics/posts`. The
   * endpoint filters by `platform` and nothing else (`handlers/analytics.go`),

   * screen cannot ask the server its own question. Until it takes a
   * `campaign_id` (or the rows carry one), the page fetches one 100-row page,
   * intersects it with the campaign's posts client-side, and sums the rows
   * itself; the server's `overview` is deliberately ignored. Beyond ~100
   * measured posts in a workspace that is no longer complete, which is why
   * every surface states its coverage.

   * column, and `services/api/brand.ts` is a **stub** — a JSON seed and
   * `localStorage` standing in for a server so the screens can be used rather
   * than only looked at.
   *

   * by a server: a workspace's voices would live in one browser, on one

   * endpoints exist would ship a feature that quietly forgets — and a
   * workspace's brand rules are the last material anyone would expect to
   * retype. Turn it on locally to work on the screens; turn it back before you
   * push.
   *
   * **Waiting on:** everything in CON-228. In outline — Brand entities per
   * workspace, tenant-scoped and fail-closed; one fetch that returns **every
   * slot including the empty ones**, because an omitted key and an empty slot
   * are different things on this screen; a voice reference plus a local delta
   * on the post (replacing free-prose `toneNotes`) and on the campaign
   * (replacing `tone_guidelines`); the generation flows reading guardrails
   * always, the assigned voice per post, the audience per campaign; and binary
   * handling for logos and overlays, where SVG is the open question (CON-132
   * §10.4).
   *
   * Nothing outside this flag may read any of it. CON-226's shape is still
   * moving, and per the global rule a half-defined field read by another
   * screen is worse than a missing one — which is exactly what happened when
   * `campaignReadiness` read `estimated_post_count` mid-redefinition.
