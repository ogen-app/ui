# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for working in this repository. Keep it accurate — update it when the
conventions below change.

## What this is

The React + Vite single-page app for **Ogen**, a multi-tenant, AI-assisted
platform for planning, generating, and publishing social-media content. This
repo is **front-end only**; it talks to the Go API (`ogen-app/ogen`) over
app-relative `/api` requests. Split out of the `ogen` monorepo (CON-98).

**Direction:** Ogen is transitioning to a multi-tenant SaaS where **Claude and
Zernio run centrally "under the hood"** — their keys are platform-managed, not
tenant-configured (CON-97 §10.3, CON-99); tenants still connect their own social
accounts. **Current front-end priorities:** the **Post Assistant + post-editing
UIs** (CON-42/61) and **completing the multi-tenancy cutover** (retire the
per-instance API-key config). Content-Bank AI images are secondary. See
[`docs/product.md`](./docs/product.md#direction--current-priorities).

- **Product & domain:** [`docs/product.md`](./docs/product.md)
- **Front-end architecture:** [`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md)
- **Technical decisions & rationale:** [`docs/technical-decisions.md`](./docs/technical-decisions.md)
- **Run & deploy:** [`README.md`](./README.md)

Requirements live in Linear under the **`CON-`** project (the app's internal
name is "Content Control Center"). There is no PRD checked into this repo.

## Stack

React 18 + TypeScript · Vite 7 · TanStack Router / Query / Table / Virtual ·
Zustand 5 · react-hook-form + Zod 4 · Tailwind CSS v4 (CSS-first) · Radix +
CVA (shadcn "new-york") · BlockNote · Phosphor icons. Node ≥ 24.15, pnpm.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # Vite dev server on http://localhost:9002, proxies /api → :9001
pnpm build      # tsc (type-check) && vite build → dist/
pnpm preview    # serve the production build
pnpm lint       # eslint . --ext ts,tsx
```

Run the API separately from the `ogen` repo (`make run`) or via
`docker compose up`. See [`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md#build--tooling).

## Conventions & gotchas

Most of these are load-bearing — see `docs/technical-decisions.md` for the why.

- **`src/routeTree.gen.ts` is generated.** Never edit it. It regenerates from
  `src/routes/` via the Vite router plugin.
- **Route file split:** `index.tsx` owns routing (`createFileRoute`,
  `beforeLoad`, `validateSearch`); the co-located **`page.tsx` is
  intentionally invisible to the router** and holds the presentational
  component.
- **Trailing-underscore route segments** (`$campaignId_`, `content-bank_`)
  deliberately escape the parent layout to render fullscreen.
- **Auth is guarded once, in `routes/__root.tsx`** `beforeLoad` — not on
  `_authenticated`. Distinguish `ServerUnavailableError` (→ `/server-unavailable`)
  from a 401 (→ `/auth/login`).
- **Server state → TanStack Query; UI/session state → Zustand.** Don't hold
  fetched data in a store. Query keys are co-located per hook and exported when
  another hook must invalidate them. Note the post editor (`["post", id]`) and
  post list (`["campaigns", id, "posts"]`) are separate namespaces.
- **The post editor autosaves through the Query cache** (`usePost.changeDoc`,
  600ms debounce, generation-counter guarded, flush-on-unmount). Campaign forms
  autosave similarly. Prefer these patterns over new local edit stores.
- **Unscheduling a post is a `cancel`, not a status `PUT`** — see
  `lib/postStatusMachine.ts` and `docs/technical-decisions.md#cancel-vs-transition`.
  Getting this wrong can publish a post the user thought was cancelled.
- **`src/lib/*` mirrors Go server rules** (`postStatusMachine`, `assetStatus`,
  platform gating). The server is the source of truth; keep these in sync when
  the backend changes.
- **All API calls go through `services/api/`** with `credentials: "include"`.
  Use `apiJson`/`apiVoid` from `http.ts` unless a resource needs progress
  (`uploads` uses XHR) or typed errors (`zernio`).
- **Styling is CSS-first:** the theme and tokens live in `src/index.css`; there
  is no `tailwind.config.js`. Use `cn()` from `lib/styles.ts`. Apply z-index
  from `config/zIndex.ts` via inline `style={{ zIndex }}`, not `z-[…]` classes.
- **Two form systems by design:** lightweight `useFormValidation` for auth
  forms, full RHF + `ui/form.tsx` for feature forms.
- Import with the `@/` alias (→ `src/`). Imports use explicit `.ts`/`.tsx`
  extensions (`allowImportingTsExtensions`). TS is strict — no unused
  locals/params.

## Known stubs / gaps

Instance Settings **API-key** config (Anthropic/Zernio) is **legacy** — keys are
centralized under the SaaS model, so that surface is slated for removal (account
connection stays) · `users.getMe()` returns a placeholder user (awaiting
`GET /api/me`) · dark mode is scaffolded but empty · the Content-Bank **Imagery**
tab is not populated yet · eslint/prettier/stylelint have no committed config in
this repo.

## Global rule

Do not keep backwards compatibility unless explicitly required.
